# Bluetooth-Temperature-Sensor

Coded by Chunguang(Eric) Xie in 2018

This is a practice project using TIVA tm4C123 micro-controller and Sparkfun RN42 bluetooth module.
The temperature sensor is built-in in The micro-controller and I used ADC module to get the data from it.
The user could use a computer to wirelessly communicate to the sensor and it would print the result on the screen.
